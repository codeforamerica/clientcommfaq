## How do I add and delete clients?

### Add a client

![Adding a new client.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeforamerica/clientcommfaq/master/assets/images/addclient.gif)

To add a new client to your contact list, click the "new client" button on the home page. Enter their name and phone number, and assign them a status. You can also add a note about the client. You can use this for anything you like: their ID number, upcoming court dates, or any personal information that will help you connect with them. 

### Delete a client
If you don't want to see a client on your contact list anymore, you can delete them. To delete a client, click on their name, then click the "manage client" button. Scroll down, and click the "delete" button. If you change your mind, you can add them back using the "new client" button on the homepage.

If a client sends you a text message after you've deleted them, they will be restored to your contact list so that you can respond to them. You won't miss any messages from them.

## How do I send and receive a single message?

### Send a message

To send a message to a client, click on the client's name in your client list. If you can't find them easily, simply search for their name in the search bar. Type out your message and click "send". Underneath the message, you should see text that says "queued", then "sent". If the message was successfully delivered, it will say "delivered." If the message couldn't go through, it will show an error. 

### Receive a message

When a client sends you a message, you will receive an email notification. You can also see the new message on your ClientComm homescreen. If you click the notification, you will be able to read the message and respond to them. 


## How do I schedule messages to be sent at a later date?
Learn how to write a text now, and send it later.

![Scheduling a message.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeforamerica/clientcommfaq/master/assets/images/scheduledmessage.gif)

Click on the name of the client you want to send a message to. Click the "send later button" next to the send button. Write your message, then select the time and date you want it sent on. Then hit the "scheduled message" button. You can edit or delete the message at any point before it sends.


## How do I send a message to multiple clients at once?
Learn how to send a mass message.

On the homepage, click the "mass message" button. Write your message, then select your recipients. You can check off just a few clients, or use the "select all" checkbox to choose all of them. There is no limit to the number of clients you can message at once. Then hit send!

The messages will go into the clients’ individual conversation pages, so you can easily keep track of replies. And there's no need to worry about privacy, the recipients won’t be revealed to each other. It’s just like BCCing an email.

### Use mass messages for:
  - Checking in with multiple people at once
  - Announcing an office closure or vacation
  - Sending a reminder to class attendees
  - Promoting a job fair or other event
  
### Keep in mind

Your clients value the individual relationships you build with them. Strike a balance between personalized messages and mass messages. Only send mass messages when they’re relevant to all of the recipients.


## How do I transfer a client to another officer?
To transfer a client to another case manager, simply go to the "Manage" page for that client. Scroll below the client's details until you see the "Transfer Client" section. Select which case manager you'd like to transfer the client to and, if you want, add a note. Click "transfer". The new case manager will now see the client when they log into ClientComm.

![Transferring a client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeforamerica/clientcommfaq/master/assets/images/transferclient.gif)


When you transfer a client, your messages won't transfer to the new case manager. If you'd like to share your conversation with them, download a transcript of the conversation before you transfer the client and share that directly.

## What happens if a client calls the ClientComm phone number?
ClientComm can transfer calls to your desk phone.

The ClientComm phone number can only be used to send and receive text messages. The good news is, ClientComm can automatically redirect incoming calls to your desk phone number. You’ll need to add your desk number (or any phone number you can receive calls at) to your account settings page. This will make it easier and less confusing for clients to get in touch with you.

What happens if you don’t don’t have a desk phone number specified on your settings page? Callers will be automatically redirected to the department's main office front desk. 

## What happens If a client changes their phone number?

If a client changes their phone number, and tells you in-person, you can update the phone number in the Edit Settings section. 

If a client texts or calls the ClientComm number, and their case manager has not updated their phone number in ClientComm, ClientComm will not yet recognize they are your client.

The ClientComm team will try to gather more information to match them to their case manager. During the matching process, they will be an "unclaimed client" in our system.

## What happens when a client texts me from their new phone number?

Sometimes, clients will text the ClientComm phone number from their new phone, to tell you they have a new number. 

In that case, they will be sent to our "unclaimed clients" inbox, and the ClientComm team will determine their case manager, then move them to the correct case manager's "My Clients" list.  

## What happens if a client calls me from their new phone number?

Sometimes, a client will call the ClientComm phone number from a new number, to tell you they have a new number.

ClientComm will not be able to match the client to the case manager and re-direct the call to the case manager's desk line as usual. Instead, ClientComm will re-direct the call to the department's main office front desk, to be connected to the case manager. 

Once the case manager updates the phone number in ClientComm, calls from the client's new phone number will re-direct to the case manager's desk line.
