## How does ClientComm work?

ClientComm allows you to send text messages to your clients, right from your computer. It runs in your web browser, so you can use it from any computer or smart phone. Clients receive your messages on their phones, like any normal text. 

Everyone using ClientComm has the same phone number. How does that work? Behind the scenes, ClientComm routes messages from clients to the correct case manager. This routing is based on which clients are on which contact lists.


## Why should I use text messages?

You have lots of ways to communicate with your clients. What makes texting different?

## How do I send a message to multiple clients at once?
Learn how to send a mass message.

![Sending a mass message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeforamerica/clientcommhelp/master/MassMessage.gif)

On the homepage, click the "mass message" button. Write your message, then select your recipients. You can check off just a few clients, or use the "select all" checkbox to choose all of them. There is no limit to the number of clients you can message at once. Then hit send!

The messages will go into the clients’ individual conversation pages, so you can easily keep track of replies. And there's no need to worry about privacy, the recipients won’t be revealed to each other. It’s just like BCCing an email.

### Use mass messages for:
  - Checking in with multiple people at once
  - Announcing an office closure or vacation
  - Sending a reminder to workshop attendees
  - A job lead that more than one client might be interested in

### Keep in mind

Your clients value the individual relationships you build with them. Strike a balance between personalized messages and mass messages. Only send mass messages when they’re relevant to all of the recipients.

## How do I schedule messages to be sent at a later date?
Learn how to write a text now, and send it later.

![Scheduling messages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeforamerica/clientcommhelp/master/ScheduledMessage.gif)

Click on the name of the client you want to send a message to. Click the "send later button" next to the send button. Write your message, then select the time and date you want it sent on. Then hit the "scheduled message" button. You can edit or delete the message at any point before it sends.

## How do I make a template or canned message?

Do you find yourself writing the same message over and over? ClientComm's template feature lets you write a message, and save it to use in future conversations. When you're talking to a client, you have access to a list of your templates to easily select and send. 

### How to make and use templates

![Making and using templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeforamerica/clientcommhelp/master/template.gif)

Click on the "templates" link in the top menu, then click the "new template" button. Write your template, and give it a name. The template name isn't part of the message recipients see, it's just for you to keep track of your templates.

When you're ready to use a template, click on the name of the client you want to send it to. In the text area, where you normally type your message, click the speech bubble icon on the right. This will pop up a list of your templates. Click on the one you want to use. Make any changes you want to make to the message, then hit send! 

### Use templates for:
  - Introduction texts
  - Check-ins and follow ups
  - Addresses
  - Any full or partial message you need to send frequently

### Customize it
After you select a template, you can add or remove text before you send it. Try using a template as a starting point, and add on a customized sentence or two. This lets you save time, while still maintaining a personal touch.

### Use placeholders
Templates need to be generic so you can use them with any client, on any day. But you can use placeholders that prompt you to fill in relevant information like a name or date. Just make sure you replace them with real information before you send your message!

## What happens if a client calls the ClientComm phone number?
ClientComm can transfer calls to your desk phone.

The ClientComm phone number can only be used to send and receive text messages. The good news is, ClientComm can automatically redirect incoming calls to your desk phone number. You'll need to add your desk number (or any phone number you can receive calls at) to your account settings page. This will make it easier and less confusing for clients to get in touch with you.

What happens iff you don't don't have a desk phone number specified on your settings page? Callers will hear a recording advising them that the number can only receive text messages and that they should hang up and send a text.

## How do I update my account settings?

Change your password, email address, and more.

To update your account settings, click on the "account" link in the top menu, then click "account settings". You can change your name, email address, desk phone number, or password here.

## How do I add and delete clients?

### Add a client

![Adding a new client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeforamerica/clientcommhelp/master/AddClient.gif)

To add a new client to your contact list, click the "new client" button on the home page. Enter their name and phone number, and assign them a status. You can also add a note about the client. You can use this for anything you like: their CalJobs ID, the training center they’re at, a list of their skills. 

### Delete a client
If you don't want to see a client on your contact list anymore, you can delete them. To delete a client, click on their name, then click the "manage client" button. Scroll down, and click the "delete" button. If you change your mind, you can add them back using the "new client" button on the homepage.

If a client sends you a text message after you've deleted them, they will be restored to your contact list so that you can respond to them. You won't miss any messages from them.

## What happens if I need to text a client who's assigned to someone else?

You can only exchange messages with clients on your contact list. A client can only be one user's contact list at at a time. If you need to message a client who's assigned to someone else, get in touch with your administrator. They can transfer the client to you.
